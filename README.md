# n8n-nodes-twakedrive

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use Twake Drive in your n8n workflows.

[Twake Drive](https://twake-drive.com/) is an open source file sharing and storage platform focused on privacy and security. It‚Äôs built for efficient team collaboration with shared spaces, real-time editing, and seamless file organization. The Twake Drive app relies ont the [Cozy stack API](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/tree/master/docs) for permissions management and files operations.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Credentials

This node uses a custom credential type to connect to your Twake instance via the Cozy Stack. You‚Äôll need :

- A Twake instance installed locally
- An app token generated from your local stack

> **Note:**
> Currently, token generation is only possible via a locally installed Cozy Stack using this script :

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# === Config ===
INSTANCE_URL="YOUR_INSTANCE_URL" # https://yourinstance.mycozy.cloud or https://yourinstance.twake.linagora.com
INSTANCE_NAME="YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME" # yourinstance.mycozy.cloud or yourinstance.twake.linagora.com
APP_NAME="n8n" # mandatory to register the client
REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost/blank" # required to register the client
SCOPES=(io.cozy.files) # full R/W on files
EXPIRE="" # optionnal: ex "30d" or "1h" for --expire

# === 1) Register OAuth client (return client_id) ===
CLIENT_JSON=$(cozy-stack instances client-oauth "$INSTANCE_NAME" "$REDIRECT_URI" "$APP_NAME" "$APP_NAME" --json 2>/dev/null || true)
if [ -n "${CLIENT_JSON}" ] && [ "${CLIENT_JSON}" != "null" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(echo "$CLIENT_JSON" | jq -r '.client_id')
else
  # if already register : find it by software_id = APP_NAME
  CLIENT_ID=$(cozy-stack instances find-oauth-client "$INSTANCE_NAME" "$APP_NAME" 2>/dev/null | awk '/client_id/ {print $2}')
fi

if [ -z "${CLIENT_ID:-}" ] || [ "$CLIENT_ID" = "null" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Impossible de r√©cup√©rer client_id (enregistrement client OAuth)."
  exit 1
fi

# === 2) Generate app-token ===
if [ -n "$EXPIRE" ]; then
  ACCESS_TOKEN=$(cozy-stack instances token-oauth "$INSTANCE_NAME" "$CLIENT_ID" "${SCOPES[@]}" --expire "$EXPIRE")
else
  ACCESS_TOKEN=$(cozy-stack instances token-oauth "$INSTANCE_NAME" "$CLIENT_ID" "${SCOPES[@]}")
fi

if [ -z "${ACCESS_TOKEN:-}" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Impossible de g√©n√©rer l'access token OAuth."
  exit 1
fi

echo "$ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This will generate the token you will need to copy into the node's credentials along your instanceURL to execute your workflow.

_Token generation via your Twake Drive instance's settings is planned in future versions._
