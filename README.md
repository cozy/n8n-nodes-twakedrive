# n8n-nodes-twakedrive

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use Twake Drive in your n8n workflows.

[Twake Drive](https://twake-drive.com/) is an open source file sharing and storage platform focused on privacy and security. Itâ€™s built for efficient team collaboration with shared spaces, real-time editing, and seamless file organization. The Twake Drive app relies ont the [Cozy stack API](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack/tree/master/docs) for permissions management and files operations.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Credentials

This node uses an OAuth 2.0 authentication.

> **Note:**
> For now, client creation is only possible via a cURL or HTTP request. See the tutorial below.

In both cases, the first step is to create a new credential in your n8n app. Select `Twake Drive OAuth2 API` in the list.
You must do this first, because youâ€™ll need the `OAuth Redirect URL` shown in the credential setup window.

```curl
curl -X POST "https://<INSTANCE_URL>/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  --data-raw '{
    "redirect_uris": ["<N8N_REDIRECT_URL>"],
    "client_name": "n8n Twake Drive",
    "software_id": "github.com/cozy/n8n-nodes-twakedrive",
    "client_kind": "web"
  }'
```

#### CURL method

- Replace `INSTANCE_URL` with your instance domain (e.g `https://example.mycozy.cloud` or `https://example.twake.linagora.com`)
- Replace `N8N_REDIRECT_URL` with the `OAuth Redirect URL` you copied from the credentials setup window
- Send the modified cURL request in your terminal
- Copy both the `client_id` and the `client_secret` from the response
- Paste those values into the appropriate fields in the credentials setup window
- Fill the remaining fields as shown in the examples under each field
- Connect to your instance

#### N8N node method

Doing it all in n8n is possible. Follow these steps:

- Replace `INSTANCE_URL` by your instance domain (e.g `https://example.mycozy.cloud` or `https://example.twake.linagora.com`)
- Replace `N8N_REDIRECT_URL` with the `OAuth Redirect URL` you copied from the credentials setup window
- Create a new workflow and add an `HTTP Request` node from n8n node search panel.
- Click Import cURL (currently located in the upper-right of the node panel).
- Paste the modified cURL request
- Execute the node
- Copy both the `client_id` and the `client_secret` from the response
- Paste those values into the appropriate fields in the credentials setup window
- Fill the remaining fields as shown in the examples under each field
- Connect to your instance

Ta-da ðŸŽ‰, you are now connected via OAuth2.

_Client registration via the instance's settings is planned for future updates_
